		You can connect the CSS to the HTML here, 
		inside the head tag. Here is an example:
		https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp
	
		Your CSS is inside the css folder in this project, 
		so you will link to "css/style.css" instead of just 
		"style.css". The css/ represents the folder.

<body>
	<!-- 
	This is an HTML comment. 
	It is optional, and you can delete it or use it to
	source help you get from AI tools like ChatGPT.

	Make sure all of your content is inside the body tag.

	If you'd like to add an image, save it to the images
	folder. Then, add an img tag. Here is an example:
	https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp

	Like your CSS link above, you are linking to a file
	inside a folder in this project, so you'll need to link
	to "images/your-image-name.jpg" for the image to show.
